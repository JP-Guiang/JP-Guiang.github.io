        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>

          <p>
          For a long time people thought that one’s ability is pre-determined and there is no room for improvement. But in recent years increasing number of research shows has shown that the brain is able to create and strengthen its neural connections that are related to tasks (playing piano, shooting a basketball, math, etc). This is neuroplasticity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is not bound to physical practice. It’s been shown that simply thinking or meditating about the tasks almost have the same benefits in building these neural connections, as performing the tasks itself. This can be very beneficial to people who are rehabilitating from physical injuries, but also help people with mental disabilities.

          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing that oneself is not limited by a skill ceiling is encouraging and breaks down barriers that human goals are only achievable because of natural ability. Now we know that everyone’s goals is achievable through both physical practice and mental practice.
          </p>

          <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
          <p>
            Mental practice such as meditation is so accessible and has proven benefits. I can use meditation to practice some skills I want to improve on such as playing piano, mindfulness or learning a language.

          </p>
          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p>By constantly practicing specific tasks or meditating about them I can strengthen the neural connections of the brain.

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <div>
            
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
            <p>
              Growth mindset is believing that your talents and abilities are not limited and they can be developed and improve through practice. It is relevant as with a growth mindset you can have a more positive outlook on your abilities and focus on becoming a better version of yourself, whereas a fixed mind set, people can get hung up on proving that they are smart/skilled.

            </p>
            <p>
              Having a growth mindset can be very beneficial as you know that success is only limited by how much effort you put in rather than how skilled you are.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>
              For a long time I have known that people can become better through practice and repetition but it has always been in conflict with my own personal ‘fixed mindset’. I have been surrounded by naturally gift people for the better part of my life and adopting a fixed mindset to justify that I wasn’t as gifted was sort of a defense mechanism  and I realize that now.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Now knowing the background behind neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I should try to fall back on those principals whenever self doubt arises.

            </p>

            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Being in Dev Academy it is great to know that you dont just ‘fail’ on projects and such, and a more learning focused environment is emphasized. With this in mind I can adopt the growth mindset and believe that with practice and hardwork I can overcome the challenges that I face.

          <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
          <p>
            Knowing about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset I know that I am not in a race with anyone or with people. I know that with time I can achieve my goals as long as I keep practicing and working hard.
