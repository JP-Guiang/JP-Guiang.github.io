        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        
        <div>
          <h3 class="italics">"The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” - Salovey and Mayer 1990</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Like congnitive intelligence or IQ, someone can improve their emotional intelligence through practice and study. Some ways a person can improve their emotional intellgence are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Practicing mindfulness</li>
            <li>Becoming more self aware and have self control</li>
            <li>Creating mental habits</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="italics">"Mindfulness is the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to things as they are." - Jon Kabat-Zinn</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Self-knowledge and self-mastery means that one can see what they are experiencing internally. That person is self aware and with that awareness they can find out what to do in order to help themselves. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Practices such as meditation can help improve one's mindfullness as it helps someone focus and be more attentive. The goal of meditation should not be to become more calm and clear minded (although they are side effects of mediation), but it is to become more present and be in the moment without letting human emotion or natural reactions affecting our perception.
            From this people can discern and make decisions that are less emotionally charged.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is different from cognitive intelligence (IQ). Where IQ is a measure of how capable a person is with solving problems, memory or quantative reasoning, EQ is someone's ability to identify emotions, relate to other people and communicate with others.
            Some people describe IQ as book smarts and EQ as street smarts.
            You can also say that IQ is a measure of someones hard skills (computation, memory etc) while EQ is soft skills (socialising, listening and communicating).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Having high EQ means that someone is able to build relationships, is trustworthy, address stress and help defuse conflicts. All of these factors are extremely positive in a working environment and will help people stand out to recruiters.
            You can even ask yourself, would you rather work with a really smart person who is unapproachable and terrible to work with, or someone who is capable but not the best, but is great to work with and improves team morale?
