        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        
        <div>
          <h3 class="italics">"The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” - Salovey and Mayer 1990</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Like congnitive intelligence or IQ, someone can improve their emotional intelligence through practice and study. Some ways a person can improve their emotional intellgence are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Practicing mindfulness</li>
            <li>Self Awareness and Self Management</li>
            <li>Creating mental habits</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="italics">"Mindfulness is the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to things as they are." - Jon Kabat-Zinn</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Self-awareness is the ability recognise their emotions, triggers, motivations and goals. 
            They are also able to see how each of these affect their thoughts and behaviour. 
            From a person's self-awareness they are able to handle their emotions and impulse behaviour. This is self-management. 
            Everyone will experience negative emotions, what separates people who have high EQ and low EQ are the ability to manage those emotions. 
            No one likes to be in a bad mood, it can  negatively affect a person's well-being, therefore learning self-awareness and self-management can help people whenever they are feeling low.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Practices such as meditation can help improve one's mindfullness as it helps someone focus and be more attentive. The goal of meditation should not be to become more calm and clear minded (although they are side effects of mediation), but it is to become more present and be in the moment without letting human emotion or natural reactions affecting our perception.
            From this people can discern and make decisions that are less emotionally charged.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is different from cognitive intelligence (IQ). Where IQ is a measure of how capable a person is with solving problems, memory or quantative reasoning, EQ is someone's ability to identify emotions, relate to other people and communicate with others.
            Some people describe IQ as book smarts and EQ as street smarts.
            You can also say that IQ is a measure of someones hard skills (computation, memory etc) while EQ is soft skills (socialising, listening and communicating).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Having high EQ means that someone is able to build relationships, is trustworthy, address stress and help defuse conflicts. 
            All of these factors are extremely positive in a working environment and will help people stand out to recruiters.
            Ask yourself, would you rather work with a really smart person who is unapproachable and terrible to work with, or someone who is not the best, but is great to work with and improves team morale?
          </p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Those who have high EQ are able to empathize and manage relationships well. 
            People who have empathy are able to take into peoples feelings, concerns and points of view and is an important skill when working in teams, clients or external vendors. 
            Having high EQ and emotional awareness between team members is an important skill to have in order to reduce/handle conflict and work harmoniously.
            
          </p>

          <p>
            Valuing different perspectives will allow teams to solve problems in a unique and innovative way. 
            Managers who have high EQ will be able to guide and develop their team members and bring out the best in them. 
            Having high EQ will present great opportunities for people to thrive in a team environment but also manage teams in leadership positions.
