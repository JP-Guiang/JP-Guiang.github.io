        <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>

        <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>

            In my previous work place I was part of the engineering team that manufactures masks for OSA patients. In our manufacturing process we have to ensure that all products meet the international standards to ensure that patients receive the correct amount of oxygen during therapy, otherwise they may get brain damage. On one evening my colleague and I noticed that the products being made did not seem normal even though they were passing the tests that were set in place. We decided to stop production and put all the products in a quarantine location knowing that this would have a massive cost to the company and add an enormous amount of work for our team. Even though we had no proof that the product was bad we also had no proof that the product was good and safe for the patient as well. I relied on my personal value of protecting life, and decided that it was better to be safe than sorry. The managers were happy that we identified a potential problem. We later identified that the product was not working as intended but there was still no harm to the patient.

        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>

        <div>
          <p>Filipino culture has a very strong emphasis on family.
            Every time there is a family emergency, my elders have always shown that no matter how far or how long it has been since we last saw each other, they will drop everything and come to help however they can.
            This has made me put family as my number one priority and always think about them when making big life decisions.
            I also know that I can always rely on my family when needed and vice versa.
            Filipino culture also has a strong desire to be successful, elders often want their children to be an engineer, nurse, doctor or lawyer. In this generation I realised that anyone can make money if they work hard especially for their passions. Because of this I’m opening my eyes to other career paths and encouraging people to follow what they truly want and if they work hard they will find success.

        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>

        <div>
          <p>Due to the nature of my previous job, I was required to learn lots of new processes in short amounts of time
            Because of this, I may have a slight advantage of learning new things whereas before I struggled to learn new concepts.
            I have always wanted to learn new things when I joined the workforce so I think it will be helpful as I am transitioning into the tech industry, as new technology comes out every year and will keep me excited and curious.
            I am a very distractible person and my attention span is very short, and I can go from one task to another
            I also have a lot of interests so I find myself randomly zoning out and thinking about my hobbies when I am studying
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>

        <div>My improved ability to learn a lot of things in a short amount of time will help during this course as we are being introduced to a lot of concepts in a short amount of time, and we are expected to put those concepts into problems. My issue would be since there are a lot of concepts to learn I might get distracted and think about other concepts when I should be focusing on another.
        </div>

        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            In my previous work place there was someone who thought they understood the working environment better than our team which has been there for years. They were stubborn in listening to what we had to say and were focused on their solutions. In order to bring them back to reality we had to show examples of and show them real life scenarios of how the production environment worked. Although they were convinced their ideas would work we had to show him how their idea would be like on the field and show them that it was not feasible.
            They were effective in eventually getting my previous colleague to work with us, but it was not the most efficient strategy as it was the most time consuming.
            I like to discuss with people I work with and listen to everyone’s ideas. It is good to have trust among the members, especially when some people have more experience than others. In this case it seemed like my ex-colleague trusted themselves more than their team who had more experience than him. Rather than quarrel we had to just show him real life examples and scenarios of what was actually happening. 
            I am always open to ideas and trying things, but sometimes people also need to consider and respect others' experience in the field. I feel like at that time it was the only strategy that would work as there was not enough trust between team members, so we had to build his experience in order for us to work in collaboration better.
