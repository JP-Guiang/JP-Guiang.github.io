      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
        I am currently transitioning from mechanical engineering to software development.
        The reason I am studying at Dev Academy is so that I can learn how to become a full stack developer but also to build on important human skills.
        Once I finish studying at Dev Academy I plan on learning another programming language such as Python. Apart from learning other languages, I plan on learning cloud based systems such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform.
        I have always liked making things and I chose to make the switch from engineering to software development as I felt that I can make more impactful products as a software developer. 
        Some projects that I plan on doing after Dev Academy are a sound mixer app and device that will allow users to control the volume of different computer apps individually and a parcel tracking app that will store delivery details from different delivery services in a central location.
        Ideally I would like to work for a company that develops software that help improve daily human life.

      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>

      <div>
        <p>
        One of my strengths with learning is that I can learn new things and try to apply it in a real world scenario.
        A big limitation that I have is that I am easily distracted with my learning. I can become very curious and try to learn things that are outside the scope of my learning and just fall into a rabbit whole.
        I am also quite obsessive when something is going wrong and I really want to fix it before moving forward.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>
        I hope to improve my skills with collaborating and working with others while at Dev Academy.
        Since working out of university, I have not had as many opportunities to work in group projects since then. Being at Dev Academy will give me that opportunity again. It will be important for me to be working in groups again as I imagine the tech industry will be filled with projects where each individual has multiple tasks to do and then at the end of the day we all combine our works together to make one working product.
        I know it will be challenging to create code and expect it to work with other people’s code technically, but that will bring out frustrations with each individual team member, and it would be good to learn and be exposed to that sort of environment before going back into the workforce.

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      </h3>

      <div>
        <p>
        Having the timeboxes available during foundations is very helpful because I can roughly gauge and plan my day around it. If I find myself to be spending too much time on a task than I should, then it is a big indicator that I need to ask for help or just move on to the next task.
        However once I am in bootcamp I imagine that timeboxes won't really exist when working on projects. Once bootcamp starts I need to accept if something is going wrong, ask for help as soon as possible so that I can move forward.
        Working this week and learning html and css, I realize that the point of these activities is not to learn how to become a software genius and solve every bug, but rather to learn the concepts, put it into practice and know that there will always be people to help you move forward towards your goals.

      <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          Recently I’ve become quite good at acknowledging when I am stressed, overworked or just tired from everything that is going on. 
          Whenever I have felt this way I tend to go back to my hobbies or spend time with my close friends and family.
          Friends and family have been a very important part of my life, but in recent years, I have come to cherish them more and more as we all share in our stresses and hardships.
          In most stressful situations though I have found myself wanting to spend time with myself a lot more and do my hobbies. Recently I picked up building and painting Gundam Model kits. Even though it is very time consuming, it can take a total of ten hours to build one model kit, which you can always do incrementally. I find it very relaxing as making, painting, and adding details to your model kit is a way that you can express yourself in an artistic manner if you cannot draw (like myself).

      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          One of my learning limitations is that I can spiral into trying to fix a problem for a long time. While studying at Dev Academy, I do not have the luxury of time, so if I ever encounter an issue, I will try to fix it for ten to fifteen minutes. If I cannot solve it by myself then I will ask for help and take a quick break.

      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team      </h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          A brief explanation of my expectations from the facilitator team would be to provide some advice on how to tackle problems or point me in the correct direction.
          I also expect them to be very approachable with issues that I have whether it is technical or if I ever need some special consideration from study if a personal emergency comes up.

      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>

          In the mornings I am in charge of dropping off my daughter to day-care or to her grandparents house.
          Lately since foundation is very flexible I usually take the mornings off to do some chores and get ready for the day.
          Once I pick up my child we have family time from 5:30pm - 9pm
          If I finish my work for the day I usually take time to relax for the rest of the evening, but I still have some work to do, I work for the rest of the evening.
