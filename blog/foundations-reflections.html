        <div>
          <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            One thing that I have learnt is that I can be very stubborn and when one thing is not working. I need to learn to be more self aware and when something is not going as I expect,
            I need to take a break, be nicer to myself and ask for help sooner. Because of this I need to learn that there are always people who are willing to help.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second thing I learnt about my ego is that no matter how big it can get, my family and closest friends will always remind me to be down to earth or when my ego is at it's lowest point,
            they will also be there to bring me back up.
          </p>
            Lastly, I learnt that my ego or confidence are very volatile, one day I can feel very good and self condifent and the next day I can feel totally trash. I need to remind myself that everyone has
            good and bad days. The days where I feel the least confident I know that actual science (neuroplasticity) proves that as long as I keep working towards my goals I can achieve them.
          <p>
             
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            Learning about neuroplasticity was great and alongside self awareness can be very liberating. If you are aware of what is going on with yourself emotionally, especially when going through difficult times
             you can rely on neuroplasticity and growth mindset to pick yourself back up when you are ready. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Showing empathy to yourself and others are also important when learning as all students have a united goal
             in learning something new and learning about themselves.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I was most surprised about the amount of focus on mindfullness and emotional intelligence. It was a good reminder that in the real world, being the most technically gifted or smartest
            person in the room, does not guarantee success.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            Personally the most challenging part of the core learning was the self reflection and actually thinking hard about my values and mindfullness.
            While studying in highschool and university the goal was always to get the highest grades possible, but there was not much focus on core values or employability through human skills.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            Being the smartest or most tenchically gifted person does not always guarantee a successful career, or even being a likeable person. 
            In my opinion anyone can study and become smart, anyone can learn technical skills, but being a good team player, knowing how to listen well and work with others are skills not so often taught. 
            EDA teaches students how to become a good technical web developer by teaching students how to code, but also how to be a good employee by teaching and practicing human skills.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>
            It was definitely not a waste of time. The core learning that was taught are skills and information that will be useful in any career that I will choose to be in. Human skills are used everyday 
            and in every situation. Programming skills are used by programmers and not everyone needs programming skills, but everyone should have good human skills.
